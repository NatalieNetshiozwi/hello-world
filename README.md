# hello-world
A repository is used to organize a single project. 
# My name is Natalie Otlaadisa. I am excited to learn how to code and how to be a professional in web development. I am trying to be patient with myself and trying to understand the work so that I retain it for long periods of time. I am trying to solidify my GitHub skills as they are important standard tools that we will need in coding.
